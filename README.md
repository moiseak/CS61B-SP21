## There is CS61B Spring 2021.



**I have basically completed all the Labs and Projects. I’m not interested in proj3, so I didn’t write it. If you'd like to discuss any questions, feel free to contact me via [email](https://github.com/moiseak/CS61A-SU24/blob/master/clashandclash@proton.me). I also have articles about CS61B on my [blog](https://zephyrus612.netlify.app/).**
